# SPRUCE rogue-like space game

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python.

In the game you create your ship with any combination of parts, and then fight other ships which get increasingly harder to obtain a high score. The game movement is based on SUVAT mechanics, so every ship has mass momentum etc. Each part has its own purpose, hull parts have high mass but high health, whereas engine parts are weak to damage but move the craft. Ships can also be loaded and saved. Ships the user saves may be encountered in their playthrough.

## Controls:
